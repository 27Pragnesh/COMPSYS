## Central Processing Unit (CPU)
*   Often called the 'brain' of the computer.
*   Responsible for executing instructions, performing calculations, and managing the flow of information.
*   Key specifications include clock speed (GHz), number of cores, and cache size.
*   **Clock Speed:** Determines how many instructions the CPU can process per second. Higher GHz means faster processing.
*   **Cores:** Modern CPUs have multiple cores (e.g., dual-core, quad-core, octa-core), allowing them to handle multiple tasks simultaneously.
*   **Cache:** A small, very fast memory that stores frequently used data, helping the CPU access information quicker.

## Random Access Memory (RAM)
*   Temporary storage for data that the CPU is actively using.
*   When you open applications or files, they are loaded into RAM for quick access.
*   Volatile memory: data is lost when the computer is turned off.
*   Key specifications include capacity (GB) and speed (MHz).
*   **Capacity:** Measured in gigabytes (GB), more RAM allows you to run more applications simultaneously without slowing down.
*   **Speed:** Measured in megahertz (MHz), faster RAM can transfer data to the CPU more quickly.

## Storage Devices
*   Permanent storage for your operating system, applications, and files.
*   Data is retained even when the computer is turned off.
*   Main types include Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) and Solid State Drives (SSDs).
*   **Hard Disk Drives (HDDs):** Traditional storage, uses spinning platters to store data. Generally slower but cheaper and available in larger capacities.
*   **Solid State Drives (SSDs):** Newer technology, uses flash memory to store data. Much faster, more durable, and energy-efficient than HDDs, but more expensive per gigabyte.
*   **Capacity:** Measured in gigabytes (GB) or terabytes (TB), indicates how much data can be stored.
*   **External Storage:** USB drives, external hard drives, and cloud storage provide additional storage and backup options.

## Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
*   Specialized processor designed to handle graphics rendering.
*   Crucial for gaming, video editing, 3D modeling, and other visually intensive tasks.
*   Can be integrated into the CPU (integrated graphics) or a separate dedicated card (discrete GPU).
*   **Integrated GPU:** Shares system RAM with the CPU, suitable for basic tasks and light gaming.
*   **Discrete GPU:** Has its own dedicated video memory (VRAM) and processing power, offering significantly better performance for demanding graphics applications.
*   Key specifications include VRAM capacity (GB), clock speed, and number of processing cores.
