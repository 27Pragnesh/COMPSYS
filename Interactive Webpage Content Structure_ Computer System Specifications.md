## III. Key Computer Components & Specifications
*   **A. Central Processing Unit (CPU): The Brain**
    *   What it does (executes instructions)
    *   Key Specs: Clock Speed (GHz), Cores (Dual, Quad, Octa), Cache
    *   Analogy: Chef in a kitchen (CPU), speed of chef (clock speed), number of hands (cores), quick access pantry (cache)
*   **B. Random Access Memory (RAM): Short-Term Memory**
    *   What it does (temporary storage for active programs)
    *   Key Specs: Capacity (GB), Speed (MHz)
    *   Analogy: Workbench space (RAM capacity), how fast you can grab tools (RAM speed)
*   **C. Storage Devices: Long-Term Memory**
    *   What it does (permanent storage for files and OS)
    *   Types: HDD vs. SSD (pros and cons, speed difference)
    *   Key Specs: Capacity (GB/TB)
    *   Analogy: Filing cabinet (storage), traditional vs. digital filing (HDD vs SSD)
*   **D. Graphics Processing Unit (GPU): The Artist**
    *   What it does (renders images, videos, games)
    *   Types: Integrated vs. Discrete
    *   Key Specs: VRAM (GB)
    *   Analogy: Artist painting a picture (GPU), dedicated art studio (discrete GPU) vs. shared kitchen table (integrated GPU)

## IV. How Specs Affect Performance (Practical Application)
*   **Gaming:** CPU, GPU, RAM
*   **Video Editing/Graphic Design:** CPU, RAM, GPU, SSD

## V. Interactive Exercises & Quizzes
*   **A. Match the Spec to the Component:** (e.g., GHz -> CPU, GB -> RAM/Storage)
*   **B. Scenario-Based Computer Recommendation:** (e.g., 


Recommend a computer for a student who loves gaming vs. a student who does a lot of video editing)
*   **C. Identify the Component:** (Image-based quiz where students identify CPU, RAM, etc.)
*   **D. Fill-in-the-blanks:** (Key terms related to specs)

## VI. Glossary
*   Definitions of key terms (CPU, RAM, HDD, SSD, GPU, GHz, GB, TB, Cores, VRAM, etc.)

## VII. Conclusion
*   Summary of key takeaways
*   Encouragement for further learning
